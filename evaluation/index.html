          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              In general we consider our webpage to be well accessible to a broad audience. All images have captions and alternative text that is displayed when the image is not available.
              All links are valid, have a title and are clickable. All links are in the same order as they appear on the page.
              This makes navigation easy while at the same time effortless for users that don't have a mouse.
            </p>
            <p>
              After TA feedback and reading the course material for the course we discovered some potential issues with the page. Our tables where not properly responsive,
              so the user would have to scroll horizontally on the page when viewing it with a smaller device or a screen with low resolution. Additionally, we did not properly make use of `print` queries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Below is our plan to improve those things to improve the Accessability of the website.
            </p>

          <h3>Accessibility Highlights</h3>
          <div>
            <dl>
              <dt>1.1</dt>
              <dd>Mainly sensory and decoration. We were successfully in creating alternative texts for non texts content
                for the pleasure of viewers.</dd>
              <dt>1.4.4</dt>
              <dd>Our text is resizable and responsive without quality loss.</dd>
              <dt>2.3</dt>
              <dd>Our content is not designed to cause seizures.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
            We made sure to make our website as accessible as possible. Implementing various features to help the users
            <br>with navigation around the website. To make the user experience as conformable as possible.<br>
            This also means that we had to ensure that the amount of flashing light is reduced to the minimum.<br>
            This ensures that the webpage is safe for everyone to view. We also paid attention to our responsive design<br>
            we ensured that we had no quality loss as our text size decreased. We think that these above-mentioned points<br>
            are the most relevant to our webpage.</p>

          <h3>Improvement Plan</h3>
          <div>
            <p>To improve usability and accessability of our web page, we have made a task-list of items that have to be completed.<br>We have also fixed all issues in relation to the feedback from TA.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h4>Prioritized list of improvements</h4>
            <div class="list">
              <div>
                <div class="title"><span class="prio-high">HIGH</span> - <span class="type-acc">Accessability</span> - Remove horizontal scrolling from tables by fixing column widths.</div>
              </div>
              <div>
                <div class="title"><span class="prio-high">HIGH</span> - <span class="type-usa">Usability</span> - Improve responsiveness by removing unnecessary elements on smaller screens.</div>
              </div>
              <div>
                <div class="title"><span class="prio-high">MEDIUM</span> - <span class="type-usa">Usability</span> - Make table sorting work two-ways.</div>
              </div>
              <div>
                <div class="title"><span class="prio-medium">MEDIUM</span> - <span class="type-usa">Usability</span> - Improve CSS print style for usability.</div>
              </div>

                <div class="title"><span class="prio-low">LOW</span> - <span class="type-tech">Technical</span> - Improve browser compatibility report.</div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>To improve usability and accessibility of our web page, we have made a task-list of items that have to be completed.<br>
            We have improved the sorting of the table, there is now a two-way sorting of the tables.<br>
            We will also improve css responsive design - to make the webpage more appropriate for mobile devices.<br>
            These two are high priority since we did not manage to implement them that well before.</p>
